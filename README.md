# MoveIt 🚚

A simple and clean landing page for a fictional moving service, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**.  
This project was my **first practical step into learning Bootstrap** — understanding its grid system, components, and utility classes.

## 🚀 Project Goal

To explore how Bootstrap makes responsive design easier and helps build professional-looking layouts with minimal effort.

---

## 🧪 Key Bootstrap Concepts Practiced

- ✅ Bootstrap Grid System (rows & columns)  
- ✅ Buttons & CTAs using `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, etc.  
- ✅ Bootstrap Navbar for mobile-first menus  
- ✅ Section spacing with `.mt-`, `.pt-`, `.container`, `.text-center`, etc.  
- ✅ Responsive layout without writing custom media queries

## 🧱 What’s Inside?

### 1. Navbar  
```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
  <!-- Branding & nav links -->
</nav>
```
- Used Bootstrap’s responsive navigation bar which collapses beautifully on smaller screens.

### 2. Hero Section  
- Includes a bold heading, subheading, and a call-to-action button styled with `.btn btn-primary`.

### 3. Features Section  
- Utilized Bootstrap’s grid layout with `.row` and `.col-md-4` for placing features side by side.  
- Icons or illustrative images with headings and short text below.

### 4. Footer  
- Simple footer with centered text using `.text-center` and `.py-3`.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- How to structure a webpage using Bootstrap's **container**, **row**, and **column** classes.
- How to quickly style buttons, navbars, and sections without writing custom CSS.
- The importance of utility classes like `.text-center`, `.py-5`, `.mt-4`, etc.
- How Bootstrap helps build **mobile-first responsive** designs.

This was my **introductory project** in Bootstrap, and it helped me build confidence to go on and create more complex layouts like [TinDog](https://github.com/goushithm22/TinDog), where I mastered advanced Bootstrap components like carousels, cards, testimonials, and responsive design finesse.
